# You can do some cool things with the MBR reward system.
# If you add a colon (:) to your reward, it will produce a range.
# Having '28.5:30.0' will produce a reward between those two numbers.
# If you'd like to make a creature not give a reward, set its value to '0.0'.

# To give a value to a world, give it a format like so:
# worldnamehere:
#   creaturenamehere: valuehere
